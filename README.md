# CrapsSimulation
This is a Python simulation of a Craps game, set up with 3-4-5x odds.  Start with an initial bank, play through it until that bank is exhausted.  Report final win/loss amount

There are two Python files: CrapsSimulation1000.py does the repeated simulation of playing through an initial bank roll.    The other simulation is for a 'one-shot.'  That is play thorough the bank roll once and report the win/loss ammount.
